IntelliSense
------------
- Code completion should properly escape identifiers
- We shouldn't show a completion window when typing aliases (CTE, table, column).
  It might be good enought to block completion when the previous token was the 
  "AS" keyword or an identifier. We should also block the completion when in the
  (optional) column list of a CTE (e.g. "WITH cte AS (x, y, z)").
- We should make sure the SyntaxTreeManager and SemanticModelManager queue a new
  request if the input has changed meanwhile. Also, they shouldn't advertise their
  result before they are valid. Furthermore, when they detect the input is invaliated
  they should queue a new request and advertise their current result is null.
  Needless to say, this requries all subsribers to handle the case where their result
  is null.
- When typing while the completion window we should filter the members
