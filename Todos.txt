IntelliSense
------------
- Code completion should properly escape identifiers (note this should include detecting quoted vs. parenthesized)
- We should make sure the SyntaxTreeManager and SemanticModelManager queue a new
  request if the input has changed meanwhile. Also, they shouldn't advertise their
  result before they are valid. Furthermore, when they detect the input is invaliated
  they should queue a new request and advertise their current result is null.
  Needless to say, this requries all subsribers to handle the case where their result
  is null.
- When typing while the completion window we should filter the members
