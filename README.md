# NQuery vNext

[![dev version](http://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/terrajobst/nquery-vnext.svg?style=flat)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/terrajobst/nquery-vnext)

This is a Roslyn inspired rewrite of [NQuery][nquery]. The goals are:

1. Expose the internals of the compiler as an object model to support building
   advanced editor features.

2. Maintain language parity with the previous version.

3. Utilize modern idioms to simplify implementation of the compiler.
